\section{Abstract}
A popular approach in statistical machine learning is to automatically
find the latent \emph{features} of the data that are most relevant or
informative. But a latent feature based view of concept learning does
not match up naturally with the structured symbolic knowledge that
seems to underlie people's understanding of many domains. How can we
combine the flexibility, noise tolerance, and computational
practicality of latent feature based statistical machine learning with
the symbolic knowledge representations that best capture human
understanding? Here present a learning model we dub Latent Concept
Grammars (LCGs) as a proposal. An LCG is a densely connected set of
probabilistic string rewrite rules over an initially uninterpreted set
of predicates. When fit to data using a hierarchical Bayesian prior,
these predicates assume the roles of informative latent concepts. This
approach allows us to learn knowledge that is stochastic and
recursively structured while maintaining computational
tractability. We show how learning in LCGs can be implemented using
the probabilistic logic programming system PRISM, and we present
preliminary experiments.

How do people learn systems of related concepts from
data?  Consider, for example, a school-age child's knowledge of
number. This knowledge supports a large number of related operations:
the child knows which words denote numbers, how to use those words to
label cardinalities of sets, how to translate between digit
representations and word representations of number, how to compare
cardinalities, etc. The child knows how to perform these operations
over an unbounded set of elements, even though the data that underlies
this knowledge is small and noisy. Here we propose that such systems
of related concepts can be learned via hierarchical probabilistic
inference over probabilistic string rewrite systems (PSRS) -- a mildly
context-sensitive class of probabilistic string gramamrs that
corresponds to a restricted fragment of stochastic logic programs
(SLPs). Specifically, we extend the variational
expectation-maximization algorithm for Hierarchical Dirichlet PCFGs to
accomodate PSRSs. This algorithm we present enables a tractible
compromise between highly restrictive context-free knowledge
representations and the intractability of performing similar inference
procedures over general logic programs. Empirically, we show how such
restricted string rewrite systems can capture non-trivial conceptual
knowledge and how our algorithm is able to learn such knowledge from
data.

\section{Introduction}
The vast majority of the models of concept acquisition that have been
proposed in the artificial intelligence, machine learning and
cognitive science literatures cannot represent the conceptual systems
that even young children learn. Take, for example, the school-age
child's knowledge of number. This child knows that there is no largest
number; that ``one million forty three'' and ``8439''denote numbers
but that ``one million forty billion'' and ``a82bd'' do not; that no
two cardinalities refer to the same quantity but that some number
words refer to the same cardinalities (e.g. ``two thousand'' and
``twenty-one hundred''). Moreover, the child knows how to guage the
approximate number of elements in a collection and how to count this
number exactly. In short, the child's knowledge of number consists of
a complex system of concepts over an unbounded set of entities
(i.e. the numbers). 

Children are not born with this kind of knowledge, and, since number
is a relatively recent cultural invention, nor is it likely that
children possess innate domain specific background knowledge that
makes it easier to acquire. Children only ever see a tiny fraction of
all the numbers they can reason about and this evidence is biased,
noisy, and can be unreliable. 

A fundamental challenge for cognitive science -- and for any field
interested in understanding human-like concept acquisition -- is to
provide a theory of how such complex systems of concepts can be
learned from sparse and noisy data.

People are able to learn about complex systems of related
concepts from small amounts of noisy data. A compelling approach to
understanding such learning is to frame it as Bayesian inference over
probabilistic knowledge bases. Advances in context free grammar
induction in the past couple of decades can be seen as an instance of
this approach, in which

Our goal is to understand how children can obtain semantic knowledge
about a system of concepts from the structure of relavent perceptual
stimuli. How does a child learn that prefixing ``great-'' corresponds
to adding an additional generation in kinship relationships? How does
a child learn that ``just before'' is after ``a while before'' which
is before ``a while after''? How does a child learn that if
Figure~\ref{pairOfApples} is ``a pair of apples'' then
Figure~\ref{singleApple} is a single apple? 

Our proposal is that some interesting fragments of human conceptual
knowledge can be represented as structured relations between
linguistic tokens and other perceptual inputs; that the rules that
define these relations implicitly define the concepts that are
learned; and that these rules can be learned using the tools of
hierarchical Bayesian inference. 

For example, the concept TWENTY SEVEN is defined as the collection of
representations ``27'', ``twenty seven'', ``3 times 9,'' along with a
system of symbolic rules that translate among these representations
and facilitate answered various queries. According to our hypothesis,
the difference between TWENTY EIGHT and TWENTY SEVEN is not that they
are represented in the mind by distinct mental symbols but rather that
the rules that operate on their various representations treat them in
systematically different ways.

This view implies that an attempt to construct a computational account
of concept learning in humans needs to ground out that learning in the
relavent perceptual stimuli. 

Contribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item We present Generate Rewrite Systems (GRS) -- a formalism that borrows
  heavily from Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (CITE)
\item We show how GRS, though restricted in representational capactiy,
  can capture substantial cognitively plausible first-order conceptual knowledge 
\item We propose a heirarchical Bayesian model for GRS that provides a coherent framework in which a GRS can be learned given evidence
\item We show how GRS can be transformed into PRISM programs and learned within that probabilstic logic programming system
\item We provide computational experiments that provide evidence that
  our model can provide an account of some kinds of complex conceptual

\section{The Model}
An LCG is a hierarchical Bayesian model of string tuples. It is an
extension of the Hierarhical Dirichlet PCFG model (HD-PCFG) to
Probabilistic Range Concatenation Grammars (PRCGs). Whereas the
HD-PCFG is a distribution over strings, an LCG is a distribution over
string tuples belonging to one of a set of observable
relations. 

Range Concatenation Grammars (RCGs) are a class of string grammars
that represent all and only those languages that can be parsed in time
polynomial in the length of the target
string~\cite{boullier2005range}. An RCG $G=(N, T, V, P, S)$ is a
5-tuple where $N$ is a finite set of predicate symbols, $T$ is a set
of terminal symbols, $V$ is a set of variable symbols, P is a finite
set of $M \geq 0$ clauses of the form $\psi_0 \rightarrow \psi_1 \dots
\psi_M$, and $S \in N$ is the \emph{axiom}. Each $\psi_m$ is a term of
the form $A(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{\mathcal{A}(A)}$, where $A \in
N$, $\mathcal{A}(A)$ is the arity of $A$, and each $\alpha_i \in (T
\cup V)^*$ is an argument of $\psi_m$. We call the left hand side term
of any clause the \emph{head} of that clause and its predicate symbol
is the \emph{head predicate}.

\textbf{Example:} The following is an RCG for the 3-copy language
$\{www | w \in {a, b}^*\}$:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
&S(XYZ) &&\rightarrow A(X, Y, Z)\\
&A(aX, aY, aZ) &&\rightarrow A(X, Y, Z)\\
&A(bX, bY, bZ) &&\rightarrow A(X, Y, Z)\\
&A(\epsilon, \epsilon, \epsilon) &&\rightarrow 
\end{alignat*}

A string $x$ is in the language defined by an RCG if one can
\emph{derive} $S(x)$. A derivation is a sequence of rewrite steps in
which substrings of the left hand side argument string are bound to
the variables of the head of some clause, thus determining the
arguments in the clause body. If a clause has no body terms, then its
head is derived; otherwise, its head is derived if its body clauses
are derived~\footnote{This description of the language of an RCG
  technically only holds for \emph{non-combinatory} RCGs, in which the
  arguments of body terms can only contain single variables. Since any
  \emph{combinatory} RCG can be converted into a non-combinatory RCG
  and we only consider non-combinatory RCGs here, this description
  suffices.}

We extend RCGs to Probabilistic Range Concatenation Grammars (PRCGs)
by annotating each clause $C_k \in P$ with probabilities $p_k$ such
that for all predicates $A \in N$ $\sum_{k:head(C_k)=A} p_k = 1$. A
PRCGs defines a distribution over strings $x$ by sampling from
derivations of $S(x)$ according to the product of probabilities of
clauses used in that derivation. This is a well defined distribution
as long as no probability mass is placed on derivations of infinite
length; in this paper, we only consider PRCGs with derivations of
finite length, so we need not worry about this requirement.

Now we can describe the model we introduce here, the Latent Concept
Grammar (LCG). We introduce the LCG as a machine learning model to
learn a distribution over instances of relations over strings. Unlike
a PRCG, which places a distribution over terms RCGs consist of a set
of rewrite rules, called clauses, each of which takes a termwhich
operate on a set of terms (predicates applied to arguments) to produce
new terms. Each rewrite rule is of the form:

Suppose we are given some positive instances $y_1, \dots,
y_M$ of relations $R_1, \dots, R_N$. Our model assumes that each
positive instance $y_m=R_n(\vec(x_m))$ is sampled i.i.d from a latent
stochastic grammar (LSG), $\mathcal{K}$. $\mathcal{K}$ consists of
some fixed number $K$ of clauses (i.e. rules) $C_1, \dots, C_K$ over
the $N$ observable relations plus a fixed number of $H$ hidden
relations $T_1, \dots, T_H$. The \emph{architecture} of the model is
the exact specification of the parameters $K$ and $H$ and the clauses
$mathcal{C}$. To each clause $C_i$ is associated a positive real
weights $\theta_i$.

The clauses of $\mathcal{K}$ are Horn clauses in a first order logic
with string concatenation. We will use PROLOG notation, in which lower
case letters are predicates and constants and uppercase letters are
variables. If two symbols are adjacent it means that the corresponding
strings are concatenated. For example, the following would is a valid
clause: $a(XY, XV) \leftarrow b(X, UV), a(X, X)$. In this rule $a$ and
$b$ are relations with arity two.

Let $C_1, \dots, C_{N(R)} = C(R)$ be the set of clauses whose head is
relation $R$ and let $\Theta_R$ be the set of corresponding
weights. Let $p_R(C_n) \sim \text{Discrete}(\Theta_R)$; that is, $p_R$
is a distribution over the clauses headed by $R$, such that each
clauses is sampled in proportion to its weight parameter.

A positive instance of this relation is sampled from $\mathcal{K}$ by
arbitrarily (i.e. uniformly at random) choosing a relation $R$ and
instantiating that relation by sampling a clause from $p_R$. Recursing
on this procedure for every atom in the body of this clause binds the
variables in the clause's head. 

Given this assumed generative process for the evidence, learning a
program involves inferring the parameter $\theta$ given a prior
probability distribution over their values. We place an independent
Dirichlet distribution over the parameters of every relation. This is
a natural choice that enables us to promote sparse programs, i.e.,
programs in which most of the mass is placed on a small number of
predicates and rules.

\section{Inference}
Inference in hierarchical Dirichlet processes in stochastic grammars
and stochastic logic programs have been well studied. Variational
Expectation-Maximization (VB-EM) is a popular approach, and this is
the algorithm we adopt here. The algorithm is described extensively
elsewhere (CITATION). As we will show in the following section, our
latent stochastic grammar model can be encoded as a stochastic logic
program, so that any VB-EM algorithm for that domain will suffice. 

\section{Implementation}
We implemented learning in LCG by encoding the model as a PRISM program.

TODO: Josh should write this section on how to translate an LCG into a
PRISM program.
